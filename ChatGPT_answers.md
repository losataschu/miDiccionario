FIRST ANSWER 13.09.2024:

The issue lies with the `orient` parameter you're using with `pandas.read_json`. The `orient='split'` option expects the JSON to be in a specific format that includes separate keys for 'index', 'columns', and 'data'. Your JSON doesn't follow that format. Instead, you should use `orient='records'` for your JSON structure.

Here is the correct way to load your JSON file using Pandas:

1. Ensure your JSON file (`entries.json`) looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "entries": [
        {
          "entry": "abfolgen",
          "date": [2022, 12, 29]
        },
        {
          "entry": "die Bearbeitung",
          "date": [2023, 1, 12]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

2. Use the following Python code to read the JSON file and convert it into a DataFrame with "entry" and "date" as columns:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import json

    # Load the JSON file
    with open('entries.json') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Extract the list of entries
    entries = data['entries']

    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(entries)

    print(df)
    ```

When you run this code, you should get a DataFrame with "entry" and "date" as column names:

```
            entry         date
0        abfolgen  [2022, 12, 29]
1  die Bearbeitung  [2023, 1, 12]
```

If you want to convert the 'date' list into a proper date format, you can do so with additional processing:

```python
# Convert 'date' column to proper date format
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'].apply(lambda x: f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'))

print(df)
```

This will result in the 'date' column being formatted as proper dates:

```
            entry       date
0        abfolgen 2022-12-29
1  die Bearbeitung 2023-01-12
```

#####

Of course! Let's break down the `lambda` function and how it works in this context.

### What is a Lambda Function?

A `lambda` function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The syntax is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

### Using Lambda in the Context of Your Data

In your case, the `lambda` function is used to transform the list of integers representing a date (e.g., `[2022, 12, 29]`) into a string format that can be easily converted to a proper date by Pandas.

Here's the specific line of code we're looking at:

```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'].apply(lambda x: f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'))
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`df['date']`**: This accesses the 'date' column in the DataFrame.

2. **`.apply(lambda x: ...)`**: The `apply` method is used to apply a function along the axis of the DataFrame. In this case, it applies a `lambda` function to each element in the 'date' column.

3. **`lambda x: f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'`**: This is the `lambda` function itself.
   - **`x`**: Represents each element in the 'date' column, which in your case is a list of integers like `[2022, 12, 29]`.
   - **`f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'`**: This is an f-string (formatted string literal) used to format the list into a string that looks like a date.

### Breaking Down the F-String

- **`{x[0]}`**: This accesses the first element of the list, which is the year (`2022` in the first row).
- **`{x[1]:02d}`**: This accesses the second element of the list, which is the month (`12` in the first row). The `:02d` part ensures that the number is formatted as a two-digit integer, adding a leading zero if necessary.
- **`{x[2]:02d}`**: This accesses the third element of the list, which is the day (`29` in the first row). Similarly, `:02d` ensures it is a two-digit integer.

### Example

For the list `[2022, 12, 29]`:
- **`x[0]`** is `2022`
- **`x[1]`** is `12`, formatted as `12`
- **`x[2]`** is `29`, formatted as `29`

The f-string `f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'` will produce the string `"2022-12-29"`.

### Putting It All Together

The `apply` method applies this transformation to each row in the 'date' column, converting lists like `[2022, 12, 29]` into strings like `"2022-12-29"`. Then, `pd.to_datetime` converts these strings into proper date objects.

### Simplified Example

Hereâ€™s a simplified example to illustrate how `lambda` works:

```python
# A list of dates in list format
dates = [[2022, 12, 29], [2023, 1, 12]]

# Applying the lambda function to each date list
formatted_dates = [f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}' for x in dates]

# Print formatted dates
print(formatted_dates)
```

### Explanation:

1. **`dates`**: This is a list of date lists.
2. **`formatted_dates`**: This uses a list comprehension to apply the lambda-like formatting to each date list.
   - **`f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'`**: For each list `x` in `dates`, it formats it into a string.
3. **`for x in dates`**: This iterates over each list in the `dates` list.

### Result:

When you run this code, `formatted_dates` will contain:

```python
['2022-12-29', '2023-01-12']
```

This is essentially the same transformation that is being applied to your DataFrame's 'date' column using the `apply` method and the `lambda` function.

So, integrating all this into your DataFrame code, here's the final version again:

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load the JSON file
with open('entries.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Extract the list of entries
entries = data['entries']

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(entries)

# Convert 'date' column to proper date format
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'].apply(lambda x: f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'))

print(df)
```

This will give you a DataFrame with the 'date' column correctly formatted as dates.

#####

### Using `orient='records'`

When using `orient='records'`, the JSON should be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the DataFrame. Here's how you can modify your JSON and the code accordingly:

1. **Modify the JSON file (`entries.json`)** to fit the `orient='records'` format:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "entry": "abfolgen",
        "date": [2022, 12, 29]
      },
      {
        "entry": "die Bearbeitung",
        "date": [2023, 1, 12]
      }
    ]
    ```

2. **Read the JSON file using Pandas with `orient='records'`:**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the JSON file
    df = pd.read_json('entries.json', orient='records')

    # Convert 'date' column to proper date format
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'].apply(lambda x: f'{x[0]}-{x[1]:02d}-{x[2]:02d}'))

    print(df)
    ```

### Explanation:

1. **JSON Structure**: The JSON is now a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a row.
2. **`pd.read_json('entries.json', orient='records')`**: This reads the JSON file into a DataFrame, expecting each dictionary to be a row.
3. **Date Conversion**: The `lambda` function and `pd.to_datetime` are used to convert the 'date' column from lists to proper date objects.

### Result:

When you run this code, you should get a DataFrame with "entry" and "date" as column names:

```
            entry       date
0        abfolgen 2022-12-29
1  die Bearbeitung 2023-01-12
```

Using `orient='records'` is particularly useful when your JSON data is structured as a list of records (dictionaries), which is a common format for data interchange.
